- `./wardrobe-assistant/src/assets` - static internal assets
- `./wardrobe-assistant/src/types` - type definitions
- `./wardrobe-assistant/src/components` - React components to build the UI
- `./wardrobe-assistant/src/constants` - constants

When modifying the directory structure, always update this section.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

## BACKEND

### Guidelines for NODE

#### NEST

- Use dependency injection for services to improve testability and maintainability following SOLID principles
- Implement custom decorators for cross-cutting concerns to keep code DRY and maintain separation of business logic
- Use interceptors for transforming the response data structure consistently for {{api_standards}}
- Leverage NestJS Guards for authorization to centralize access control logic across {{protected_resources}}
- Implement domain-driven design with modules that encapsulate related functionality and maintain clear boundaries
- Use TypeORM or Mongoose with repository patterns to abstract database operations and simplify testing with mocks

## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for REACT

#### REACT_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Leverage Server Components for {{data_fetching_heavy_components}} when using React with Next.js or similar frameworks
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

#### ZUSTAND

- Create separate stores for distinct state domains instead of one large store
- Use immer middleware for complex state updates to maintain immutability when dealing with nested data
- Implement selectors to derive state and prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Leverage the persist middleware for automatic state persistence in localStorage or other storage
- Use TypeScript with strict typing for store definitions to catch errors at compile time
- Prefer shallow equality checks with useShallow for performance optimization in component re-renders
- Combine stores using composition for sharing logic between stores
- Implement subscriptions to react to state changes outside of React components
- Use devtools middleware for Redux DevTools integration in development
- Create custom hooks to encapsulate store access and related business logic

#### REACT_QUERY

- Use TanStack Query (formerly React Query) with appropriate staleTime and gcTime based on data freshness requirements
- Implement the useInfiniteQuery hook for pagination and infinite scrolling
- Use optimistic updates for mutations to make the UI feel more responsive
- Leverage queryClient.setQueryDefaults to establish consistent settings for query categories
- Use suspense mode with <Suspense> boundaries for a more declarative data fetching approach
- Implement retry logic with custom backoff algorithms for transient network issues
- Use the select option to transform and extract specific data from query results
- Implement mutations with onMutate, onError, and onSettled for robust error handling
- Use Query Keys structuring pattern ([entity, params]) for better organization and automatic refetching
- Implement query invalidation strategies to keep data fresh after mutations

### Guidelines for STYLING

#### TAILWIND

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Implement Just-in-Time (JIT) mode for development efficiency and smaller CSS bundles
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Leverage the @apply directive in component classes to reuse utility combinations
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Use component extraction for repeated UI patterns instead of copying utility classes
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

### Guidelines for ACCESSIBILITY

#### MOBILE_ACCESSIBILITY

- Ensure touch targets are at least 44 by 44 pixels for comfortable interaction on mobile devices
- Implement proper viewport configuration to support pinch-to-zoom and prevent scaling issues
- Design layouts that adapt to both portrait and landscape orientations without loss of content
- Support both touch and keyboard navigation for hybrid devices with {{input_methods}}
- Ensure interactive elements have sufficient spacing to prevent accidental activation
- Test with mobile screen readers like VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)
- Design forms that work efficiently with on-screen keyboards and autocomplete functionality
- Implement alternatives to complex gestures that require fine motor control
- Ensure content is accessible when device orientation is locked for users with fixed devices
- Provide alternatives to motion-based interactions for users with vestibular disorders

## TESTING

### Guidelines for UNIT

#### JEST

- Use Jest with TypeScript for type checking in tests
- Implement Testing Library for component testing instead of enzyme
- Use snapshot testing sparingly and only for stable UI components
- Leverage mock functions and spies for isolating units of code
- Implement test setup and teardown with beforeEach and afterEach
- Use describe blocks for organizing related tests
- Leverage expect assertions with specific matchers
- Implement code coverage reporting with meaningful targets
- Use mockResolvedValue and mockRejectedValue for async testing
- Leverage fake timers for testing time-dependent functionality

## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for ARCHITECTURE

#### MONOREPO

- Configure workspace-aware tooling to optimize build and test processes
- Implement clear package boundaries with explicit dependencies between packages
- Use consistent versioning strategy across all packages (independent or lockstep)
- Configure CI/CD to build and test only affected packages for efficiency
- Implement shared configurations for linting, testing, and {{development_tooling}}
- Use code generators to maintain consistency across similar packages or modules
- Use Husky for Git hooks to enforce code quality and prevent bad commits
